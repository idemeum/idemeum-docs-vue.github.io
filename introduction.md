# Welcome to idemeum

## What is idemeum?

::: tip Zero Trust Platform
idemeum offers one place to manage access to your applications and infrastructure, without passwords.
:::

For your employees idemeum can automatically create SaaS accounts and offer one-click centralized access to applications, regardless if they are public SaaS or in your private cloud behind a firewall. For your engineers, idemeum offers unified passwordless access to your infrastructure, including servers, RDP desktops, databases, and more.

We offer a unique platform that combines Privileged Access Management (PAM), Workforce Identity (IAM), and Passwordless technology. Instead of deploying a VPN to access your private cloud apps, Single Sign-On to access your SaaS apps, PAM solution to access your infrastructure, and MFA to secure access, idemeum combines all of that in one platform.

## How we can help your business

1. **Consolidate identity stack to save money** - instead of deploying separate products for PAM and IAM, you can leverage our cloud-based unified platform to access and manage your applications and access to privileged resources.
2. **Secure company by making access to any resource passwordless** - with our Universal Passwordless MFA you can offer your employees seamless biometrics-based access to applications, desktops, Wi-Fi, VPNs, and infrastructure resources. We support integration with pretty much any resource.
3. **Manage your cloud applications** - with our Single Sign-On and Automated Provisioning you can automate account creation for onboarding and offer your employees one-click centralized access to any application from any device.
4. **Secure company passwords** - with zero-knowlege vault you can securely store, share, and auto-fill passwords. 
5. **Secure privileged access to infrastructure** - with our modern Zero Trust Network access you can replace legacy VPN and secure access to infrastructure, including on-premises apps, SSH servers, RDP desktops, databases, and Kubernetes clusters.
