## What is idemeum?

::: tip Unified Passwordless Platform
At idemeum we built a platform to manage access to applications and infrastructure without passwords. 
:::

If you think in industry terms, we combine several identity products one - **Privileged Access Management (PAM**), **Workforce Identity Management (IAM)**, and **Passwordless** technology. 

For workforce access idemeum allows to eliminate passwords across your organization and secure everything your employees access with Passwordless MFA and biometrics. For privilege access idemeum unifies secure access to on-premises applications, SSH servers, workstations, and databases across all environments.

## How we can help your business

1. **Consolidate identity stack to save money** - instead of deploying separate products for PAM and IAM, you can leverage our cloud-based unified platform to access and manage your applications and access to privileged resources.
2. **Secure company by making access to any resource passwordless** - with our Universal Passwordless MFA you can offer your employees seamless biometrics-based access to applications, desktops, Wi-Fi, VPNs, and infrastructure resources. We support integration with pretty much any resource.
3. **Manage your cloud applications** - with our Single Sign-On and Automated Provisioning you can automate account creation for onboarding and offer your employees one-click centralized access to any application from any device.
4. **Secure company passwords** - with zero-knowlege vault you can securely store, share, and auto-fill passwords. 
5. **Secure privileged access to infrastructure** - with our modern Zero Trust Network access you can replace legacy VPN and secure access to infrastructure, including on-premises apps, SSH servers, RDP desktops, databases, and Kubernetes clusters.
