Things happen - employees lose their devices, get new phones, and unfortunately sometimes our devices get stolen.</p><p>What makes things more complicated for us is that we are strictly adhering to our principle of <strong>zero-knowledge security</strong>. Users&#39; passwords are encrypted on the client side, and our cloud has no knowledge of them. Moreover, the encryption key is residing on a mobile device protected by the hardware backed storage. Therefore we have to make key recovery secure yet seamless, so that we do not introduce friction to user experience.</p><h2 id="recovery-options" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#recovery-options" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Recovery options</h2><p>Today we support two recovery options.
