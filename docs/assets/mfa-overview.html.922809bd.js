Biometric sensors such as Apple Touch ID, Face ID, and their Android counterparts, can be used to securely access devices, applications, and infrastructure using public key cryptography. Logging into a company resource becomes as simple as canning a QR-code and approving login with biometrics.</p><p>At registration, idemeum securely generates a pair of cryptographic keys in addition to FIDO2 standards. The private key is stored on the user\u2019s mobile device using hardware-backed crypto storage, whereas the public key is registered with idemeum backend. When users scan login QR-code with idemeum mobile application, they are required to authenticate with multiple factors - biometrics and certificates.</p><h2 id="idemeum-benefits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#idemeum-benefits" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Idemeum benefits</h2><ol><li><strong>Reduce cyber risk by stopping credential attacks</strong> - attackers simply can\u2019t use passwords anymore - they don\u2019t exist. idemeum can protect against login credentials being stolen or leaked in credential stuffing, credential cracking, social engineering, and phishing attacks.</li><li><strong>Improve workforce experience and productivity</strong> - idemeum eliminates user friction - no more codes, magic links, hardware devices, and remembering passwords. idemeum offers a solution where strong security meets frictionless experience.</li><li><strong>Reduce help desk calls for password resets</strong> - users no longer have to meet complex password requirements, change them every 60 days, or contact the help desk to resolve password lockouts and reset issues.</li></ol>',5),k={class:"custom-container tip"},v=s("p",{class:"custom-container-title"},"MFA Solution Brief",-1),x={href:"https://idemeum.com/portfolio/passwordless-mfa-solution-brief/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function I(F,P){const t=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return o(),n("div",null,[l,h,p,s("p",null,[s("a",u,[e("Passwordless authentication"),a(t)]),e(' is the term used to describe a group of identity verification methods that don\u2019t rely on passwords.
