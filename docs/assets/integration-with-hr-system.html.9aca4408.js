Some systems do not support Web hooks therefore we need to periodically check if there are new off-boarded employees. With this configuration you can choose how often you want idemeum to check for off-boarded employees.</li><li><strong>Corporate email format</strong> - when employees onboard into organization they are using personal email address, phone number, or ID document. However, corporate email address is required in order for idemeum to log user into applications. As a first step idemeum looks for corporate email address in user source. If found that email will be used for all applications provisioned for the user. If the email is not found, idemeum will create one on the fly. With this setting you can choose what email format you will use for all employees.
