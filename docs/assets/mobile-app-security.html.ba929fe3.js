SOC2 compliance, periodic third-party penetration testing exercises, modern state of the art cryptography - we do things the right way.</p><p>We know first hand that poor authentication security leads to account theft, data breaches, monetary losses, loss of trust, and reputation damage. What is more, a poor user experience related to authentication inevitably leads to suboptimal behavior and bad practices, which cause security incidents. Therefore, our primary goal is to make idemeum&#39;s Passwordless MFA secure without sacrificing user experience.</p><h2 id="why-we-eliminate-passwords" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-we-eliminate-passwords" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why we eliminate passwords</h2><p>Passwords cause breaches. It&#39;s as simple as that. \u{1F625}</p><p>Today passwords remain an extremely weak way to secure user accounts and a favorite target for hackers, evidenced by the fact that over 80% of data breaches involve stolen or lost passwords. Passwords are vulnerable to numerous types of security attacks, which has led to ongoing high-profile PII data breaches, the theft of billions of user accounts, and billions in monetary damage.</p><h2 id="how-idemeum-mfa-is-more-secure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-idemeum-mfa-is-more-secure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How idemeum MFA is more secure</h2><p>Here is the list of attacks and vulnerabilities that idemeum mitigates with Passwordless MFA.</p><ul><li><strong>Credential stuffing</strong> - form fields do not exist therefore attackers can not stuff them with static credentials.</li><li><strong>Credential replay attacks</strong> - attackers can&#39;t try stolen or leaked passwords because no static credentials are used.</li><li><strong>Lost or stolen token attacks</strong> - dedicated tokens are not needed so that they can not be stolen. Moreover, if a user&#39;s phone is lost or stolen, attackers can not use it because idemeum authentication requires the use of biometrics for each login.</li><li><strong>Phishing / spear phishing attacks</strong> - without static credentials, attackers can&#39;t phish them from vulnerable users.</li><li><strong>Key logging</strong> - as there are no passwords, there is nothing to log. Thus idemeum protects against malware that captures users&#39; credentials.</li><li><strong>Shoulder surfing</strong> - as there are no passwords, attackers can not physically observe or record a user inputting login credentials.</li><li><strong>Brute force cracking</strong> - there are no password hashes that we store in our cloud. Hence attackers can not leverage \u201Cguess-and-check\u201D algorithms to decipher previously stolen password hashes, making them usable in order to illicitly access user accounts.</li><li><strong>Man-in-the-middle attacks</strong> - idemeum prevents interception of credential transmissions either over a local network or via a malicious website purporting to be the intended recipient of those credentials.</li><li><strong>Social engineering</strong> - idemeum stops use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging credentials or other confidential data that can be used to defeat user authentication.</li><li><strong>Session hijacking / forgery</strong> - idemeum stops bypassing authentication by stealing or creating browser session keys that allow access to protected resources.</li></ul><p>This is orders of magnitude more secure than traditional authentication methods, let alone the fact that user experience is simple and seamless with idemeum passwordless MFA.</p><h2 id="how-we-designed-idemeum-mfa" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-we-designed-idemeum-mfa" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How we designed idemeum MFA</h2><p>idemeum passwordless MFA leverages:</p><ul><li><strong>Asymmetric cryptography</strong> to replace passwords with digital certificates</li><li><strong>Hardware backed storage</strong> to store keys that are used for authentication</li><li><strong>Secure and open standards</strong> such as SAML, PKI, FIDO2, Webauthn, DID</li><li><strong>Device attestation services</strong> provided by Android and iOS operating systems</li><li><strong>Detection of jailbroken devices</strong> in order to block application registration</li><li><strong>End to end encryption</strong> of data passing between mobile and user browsers</li><li><strong>Encryption of data at rest</strong> on a mobile device to protect identity claims</li></ul>',13);function F(O,W){const s=o("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),l("div",null,[d,e("table",null,[h,e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null,[e("a",u,[p,a(s)])]),g,m]),e("tr",null,[e("td",null,[e("a",f,[y,a(s)])]),w,_])])]),b,e("table",null,[v,e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null,[e("a",k,[x,a(s)])]),S,A])])]),M,e("p",null,[C,e("a",P,[T,a(s)]),I]),D])}const H=i(c,[["render",F],["__file","mobile-app-security.html.vue"]]);export{H as default};
