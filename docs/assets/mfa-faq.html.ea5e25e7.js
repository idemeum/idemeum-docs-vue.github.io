In the last couple of years we made it a bit more secure by adding MFA - you login with username and password, and then input one-time code or approve push notification. The problem with this way of doing things is that it is <strong>phishable</strong> and <strong>introduces significant user friction</strong>.</p><p>idemeum is a mobile application that replaces shared secrets such as passwords, PINs, SMS codes and OTPs, with FIDO2 standards. Biometric sensors such as Apple Touch ID, Face ID, and their Android counterparts, can be used to securely access devices, applications, and infrastructure using public key cryptography. Logging into a company resource becomes as simple as canning a QR-code and approving login with biometrics.</p><p>At registration, idemeum securely generates a pair of cryptographic keys in addition to FIDO2 standards. The private key is stored on the user\u2019s mobile device using hardware-backed crypto storage, whereas the public key is registered with idemeum backend. When users scan login QR-code with idemeum mobile application, they are required to authenticate with multiple factors - biometrics and certificates.</p><h2 id="how-is-idemeum-passwordless" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-is-idemeum-passwordless" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How is idemeum passwordless?</h2>',5),f={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},g=t('<p>idemeum simplifies user experience and makes employee logins completely passwordless.
