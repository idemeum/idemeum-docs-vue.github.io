New hire installs idemeum mobile application, verifies personal email / phone number, navigates to a company portal and scans a QR code. From then on idemeum picks it up - we match a personal claim to a company user record, assign corporate email address, provision SaaS apps, assign infrastructure resources, and more - pretty much everything to give an employee access to all she needs from a single place.</p><h2 id="employee-experience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#employee-experience" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Employee experience</h2><p>Employees go through 3 simple steps to onboard into company passwordless access.</p><h4 id="_1-install-idemeum-mobile-app" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-install-idemeum-mobile-app" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.
