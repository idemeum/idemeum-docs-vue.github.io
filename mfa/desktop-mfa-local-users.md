### Local user accounts

**Dedicated user mode** - if a workstaion is going to be used by a single user, then the user who is installing a desktop application, and pairing a mobile device will need to enter the password to complete the pairing and create a virtual smart card. There is no need to create any addition user accounts.

**Shared users mode** - if a workstation is going to be used by multiple roaming users, then you need to create local accounts on this workstation for each user. When a user logs into the workstation with a mobile device for the first time, she will be asked for username / password for the account that will be associated with a mobile device for passwordless login.
