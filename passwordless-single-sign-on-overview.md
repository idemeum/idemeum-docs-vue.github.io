# Passwordless Single Sign-On overview

## Overview

You might be familiar with classic [Single Sign-On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) products (Okta, Azure Active Directory, and others) that centralize access to cloud [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) applications - login with username/password once, and then access cloud applications from a consolidated dashboard.

idemeum pushes Single Sign-On to the next level by going **beyond** web applications.

::: tip What is idemeum Passwordless Single Sign-On?

idemeum Single Sign-On is what unifies all idemeum products together to provide one-click access to any company resource. It relies on [Passwordless MFA](/mfa-overview.html) for authentication, so you access everything with biometrics instead of passwords. 

Simply put, it does the following: 

1. **Unified access** - one application catalog to access all you need: [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)/[OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)) cloud applications, password applications, on-premises applications, SSH servers, RDP desktops, and more.
2. **Management plane** - gives you tools to manage users, create groups, apply entitlements, and control access with [attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control). 
3. **Auditing plane** - gives you detailed event-based audits and session recording for infrastructure access.
