## Option 1 - Self-service recovery with secure QR-code

::: tip Do you have recovery QR-code?

When you installed idemeum for the first time you were given an option to store your personal secure recovery QR-code. You had an option to download that QR code to your mobile photos or store it to your cloud storage (iCloud or Google Drive). This is the code that you can use now to perform self-service recovery. 

If you do not have this code, proceed to the next section - **Recover with admin approval**. 

:::

Here are the steps to take when recovering with your personal QR-code. With this method you will not need any IT team approval or involvement.

* Install idemeum application on a new mobile device
* Choose option to `Recover identity` on the welcome screen
* Choose option to `Recover with QR-code`
* Now you can either scan your QR-code (for example if you have it printed), or you can use your cloud storage to retrieve the code automatically.
* Once code is accepted continue with application set up: enable biometrics, verify email and phone number. **Do not forget to store your new recovery code, as the old one is no longer valid**.
* Navigate to your company portal and login. You should now have access to all your applications.
