Here is what you can do here:

*  By searching for application in the search bar you can look for pre-configured SAML SaaS applications. We support quite a few of them and provide detailed integrations guides in our [integration catalog](https://integrations.idemeum.com). Learn more about [integrating SAML applications](./integrate-saml-app.html). 
* By click `Add app` button you can set up:
	* [Custom SAML application](./integrate-saml-app.html#set-up-custom-saml-application) that is not part of the integration catalog. We will offer generic SAML set up, so pretty much any application supporting SAML can be integrated with idemeum. 
	* Remote servers to access with SSH. 
	* Remote web application that is hosted on premises behind a firewall. 

One application is configured and added it will be visible in the `My applications` section.
