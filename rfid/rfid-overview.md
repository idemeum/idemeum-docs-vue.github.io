## What is RFID Single Sign-On?

idemeum supports employees accessing resources with [Radio-frequency identification (RFID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification) cards. Instead of repeatedly typing usernames and passwords employees can leverage existing employee badges to access workstations and downstream applications. At idemeum we work with many industry verticals, including healthcare, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. 

For instance, clinicians regularly need to remember eight or more application passwords. Security best practices require those passwords be unique, strong and frequently changed. In the absence of RFID access solutions clinicians will have to type passwords multiple times a day, as often 45 min per day on average. Instead they can tap an existing badge on the reader connected to a workstation and have immediate access to workstation as well as Electronic Health Records (EHR) application.
