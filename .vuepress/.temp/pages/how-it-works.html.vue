<p>idemeum is a unified platform. What that means is that we have combined privileged access management with workforce identity management into one product and made everything employees access passwordless.</p>
<p>Our platform is modular and allows customers to choose what services they would like to deploy and integrate with existing identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>idemeum is hosted on AWS and is a SaaS product only. We try to minimize the footprint of on-premises components that our customers need to deploy. idemeum is architected as a microservices-based application, and offers high availability and security.</p>

<p>Even though our password vault is cloud based, we do not see your password as they are encrypted on the client side. Check our <a href="./security-whitepaper">security white paper</a> to learn more about our security and encryption principles.</p>
