## Overview

idemeum offers Cloud Hosted Radius service to help you protect your network and wireless infrastructure with passwordless access. Integrating with idemeum cloud Radius offers a new horizon of use cases - VPN control, MFA enforcement, VLAN segmentation, group based access control, no more shared passwords for WiFi and more.

You connect your infrastructure to a Cloud Radius server, and the communication is protected by complex shared secrets dedicated for your tenant. When your employees access VPN or WiFi they receive a familiar push notification to perform a passwordless multi-factor authentication. This way every connection is secure and offers seamless user experience for any resource that employees access in your organization.
